            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi there, I am Wouter! I'm <span data-id="age" date-birthday="{{ birthday }}">{{ age }}</span> years old and passionate about all things digital really.</p>
            <p>I studied Digital Design &amp; Development at Howest University College and am currently working as a full stack developer at <a href="http://inthepocket.mobi/" target="_blank">In The Pocket</a>. Before that I used to work as web &amp; mobile developer at a real estate startup, a new project of the Netlog &amp; Twoo founders, <a href="http://realo.com/" target="_blank">Realo</a>.</p>
            <p>When I'm not creating kickass web applications I'm fiddling around with electronics, making tracking devices, robots, drones and other (useless ..?) fun projects using Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
            <p>Besides all of that I love travelling, nature, trying new things and pushing my own limits. I'm also a data geek, graphs &amp; stats are real motivators for me (loyal Fitbit user).</p>
            <p>Oh right, also a cat person!</p>

            <h2>About this website</h2>
            <p>This website is my primary place on the internet where I collect work that I made for myself or clients. I also write here about what I do, what I like, things I experienced, guides and more.</p>
            <p><s>It grew out of an old website that used to be the face of my secondary activity, but I decided to end that because it was becoming a bit too much.</s> It's also the face of my secondary activity where I once in a while do some IT Consultancy &amp; side projects. The current revision is also the sixth time I started from scratch and changed domains twice.. Don't ask.</p>
